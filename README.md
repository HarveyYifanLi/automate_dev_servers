## automate_dev_servers
This is a simple automation script written in `JavaScript` to manage the Initialization and Change Updates of a giant project consists of 
4 `Microservices` currently, with more services to come into the mix in the future. This way, I don't have to manually spin up each dev service every time. 
The output/logging of all the servers will simply be directed to one single Terminal's `stdout`. 

Just need to cd into this directory and run command `nodemon` to execute.
